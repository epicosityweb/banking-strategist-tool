### User Story 4.6: Build Association Qualification Rules

**As a** banking strategist
**I want to** define association-based rules for tag qualification
**So that** tags are assigned based on relationships (e.g., "Member has 3+ accounts")

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Rule Components:**
- [ ] Related object selector (dropdown: objects associated with primary object)
- [ ] Count condition (dropdown):
  - has_at_least (minimum count)
  - has_exactly (exact count)
  - has_fewer_than (maximum count)
- [ ] Count value (number input)
- [ ] Property filters on related object (nested property rules):
  - Filter by field values on related records
  - Example: "Member has at least 2 Accounts WHERE Account.account_type = 'SC'"

**Visual Rule Builder:**
- [ ] Nested filter interface (reuse PropertyRuleForm pattern)
- [ ] Preview: "Member has at least 3 Accounts WHERE Account.balance > 5000"

**System Requirements:**
- [ ] Rules save as structured JSON in tag.qualificationRules array

  - greater_than_or_equal (add tag when score ‚â• X)
  - less_than (remove tag when score < X)
- [ ] Threshold value (number input, 0-100)
- [ ] Hysteresis settings (optional):
  - Add threshold (e.g., 55)
  - Remove threshold (e.g., 45)
  - Prevents "tag flapping" from small score fluctuations

**System Requirements:**
- [ ] Rules save as structured JSON in tag.qualificationRules array
- [ ] System validates score field references exist in Member object
- [ ] Preview: "Add tag when mortgage_combined_score >= 60, remove when < 45"

**Implementation Status:** üìã **NOT STARTED**

**Evidence:**
- Issue #3 (Epic 4 Master) - Phase 7 scheduled for Score Rule Builder
- tagSchema.ts:167-198 - Score rule schema defined but no UI implemented

- [ ] Medium complexity (34-66): Moderate, 3-5 conditions
- [ ] High complexity (67-100): Complex, 6+ conditions or nested logic
- [ ] System warns if complexity > 80 (performance risk)

**Visual Rule Preview:**
- [ ] Plain English translation of rules
  - Example: "Member's account type equals 'NA' AND acquisition source contains 'Dealer'"
- [ ] Logic tree diagram (optional)
  - Visual AND/OR tree showing rule evaluation flow

**Implementation Status:** üìã **NOT STARTED**

## Alignment with Banking Framework Philosophy

This user story document aligns with the Banking Journey Orchestration Framework philosophy:

**Three-Dimensional Personalization:**
- ‚úÖ Origin tags (Story 4.1-4.3): Capture acquisition channel, set trust timelines
- ‚úÖ Behavior tags (Story 4.1-4.5): Dynamic assignment based on engagement patterns
- üèóÔ∏è Opportunity tags (Story 4.6-4.7): Score-driven, cross-sell readiness (score rules not built)

**Lead Scoring Engine:**
- ‚úÖ Data model supports 12 score fields (4 products √ó 3 scores each)
- üìã Score rule builder not implemented (Story 4.7)
- üìã No visual scoring grid (Story 6.2 documentation)

**Journey Automation:**
- üìã Member Tenure Journey not built (Story 5.1)
- üìã At-Risk/Dormant journeys not built
- üìã Journey simulation not built (Story 5.2)

**Implementation Delivery:**
- üìã No HubSpot configuration export (Story 6.1)
- üìã No documentation generation (Story 6.2)

**Conclusion:** The tool successfully implements **data foundation** (Client Profile, Data Model) and **tag library** (70% complete), but lacks **journey orchestration** and **implementation delivery** capabilities needed to fully realize the Banking Framework vision.
