- **Source Directory**: `strategist-tool/`
- **Total Commits in Monorepo**: 75 commits

### New Repository

- **Commits Preserved**: 49 commits (all commits touching strategist-tool)
- **Extraction Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Extraction Method**: Git Filter-Repo (official Git-recommended tool)

### What Was Migrated

**✅ Full History Preserved**:
- 49 commits from inception to October 17, 2025
- All commit authors and timestamps maintained
- All commit messages preserved
- Complete development history intact

**✅ All Branches**:
- `main` (default branch)
- `feature/issue-21-event-property-filters`
- `fix/activity-rules-validation`
- `fix/supabase-schema-validation`

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
- Analyzed repository structure (53 commits, 97 files, 202 MB)
- Verified zero coupling between banking-journey-framework and strategist-tool
- Created backup mirror of original repository

### Phase 2: Extraction
```bash
# Fresh clone created
git clone https://github.com/epicosityweb/banking-orchestration-framework-explainer.git \
  /tmp/strategist-tool-extraction

# Extract strategist-tool subdirectory
cd /tmp/strategist-tool-extraction
git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter strategist-tool/ --force

# Result: 49 commits extracted, files moved to root
```

### Phase 3: New Repository Creation
- Created new repository: `epicosityweb/banking-strategist-tool`
- Public repository (GitHub Enterprise Internal)
- Description: "Interactive banking journey orchestration planning tool"

### Phase 4: Push to New Repository
```bash
# Add new remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/epicosityweb/banking-strategist-tool.git

# Push all branches
git push -u origin --all

# Push all tags (if any)
git push origin --tags
```

**Result**: 6 branches, 49 commits successfully pushed

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with migration notice
- Added repository, bugs, homepage fields to package.json
- Bumped version to 1.0.0 (first standalone release)
- Created this MIGRATION.md file

### Phase 6: CI/CD Migration
- Migrated GitHub Actions workflows from monorepo
- Updated paths to work with root-level structure
- Configured Node.js 20 for testing

### Phase 7: Verification
- Build verification (npm run build)
- Lint verification (npm run lint)
- Test suite execution (npm test)
- All functionality verified working

### Phase 8: Cleanup
- Added deprecation notice to monorepo strategist-tool/README.md
- Updated Issue #34 tracking migration progress
- Verified no breaking changes

## Breaking Changes

- ✅ All imports work correctly (relative paths unchanged)
- ✅ All configuration files work correctly
- ✅ All environment variables unchanged
- ✅ All npm scripts unchanged
- ✅ All dependencies unchanged
- ✅ Supabase integration unchanged
- ✅ Build process unchanged

## For Contributors

### If you had the monorepo cloned:

**Option 1: Start fresh** (recommended)
```bash
# Clone the new standalone repository
git clone https://github.com/epicosityweb/banking-strategist-tool.git
cd banking-strategist-tool
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Option 2: Update existing worktrees**
If you had worktrees in the monorepo:
1. Your worktrees in `.worktrees/` are now obsolete
2. Remove them: `git worktree remove .worktrees/[name]`
3. Clone the new repository fresh (Option 1)

### Environment Variables
Copy your existing `.env.local`:
```bash
# If you have the old monorepo
cp /path/to/old-monorepo/strategist-tool/.env.local \
   /path/to/new-repo/.env.local

# No changes needed - all Supabase credentials remain the same
```
